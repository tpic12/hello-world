# hello-world
I'm learning to code from the odin project to try to start a new career

I'm 27, based in NYC, and trying to get out of the service industry. I like rock-climbing, found the best tacos in the city (one place in queens, another in harlem), and playing video-games. I used to be a beverage director, but im getting tired of the bar life and want to try somehting new.
